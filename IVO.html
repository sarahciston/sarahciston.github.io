  <br>Could AI reprogram one's inner critic? <i>inner(voice)over</i> combines AI speech-to-text analysis and text-to-speech synthesis to question the origins of inner voices and to shift what influences an individual's outlook. Users speak a kind phrase into its acoustic dishes, and <i>inner(voice)over</i> uses <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla DeepSpeech</a> to anonymize their words and add them to its compassionate inner-voice database. Then users can hear what others have shared, restated in a synthesized AI voice. <br><br>
  By collaboratively rewriting a communal inner voice using AI--and by attending to imperfections of technological and human communications alike--this experiment explores the possibility of influencing each other through language altered across digital distances.<br><br>
