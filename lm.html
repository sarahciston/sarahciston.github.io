            <h3>ladymouth</h3>
            <p><i>ladymouth</i> is a <a href="#code">chatbot</a> that explains feminism to Internet trolls. The software automates replies to Reddit's self-proclaimed men's rights activists, answering with provocative quotations from scholars like bell hooks or Gloria Anzaldua. It logs the responses it elicits, which I incorporate into <a href="#performance">creative texts for performance (see below).</a> As a text it is deeply transdisciplinary--challenging genre and drawing equally from art practice, programming, and critical theory as it seeks to interrogate both gender and technology at their intersections. It is influenced by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun's "leaking network cards" and Sara Ahmed's "feminist killjoys," by net artists like Angela Washko and Mez Breeze, and by organizations like FemTechNet and the Fembot Collective. The bot is not intended to pass a Turing test, but to make visible an emotional labor--transferring onto the technological body the risks of death threats, rape, exposure, lost time otherwise spent writing, making, surviving. But its approach is less negging, more nagging. By repositioning critical feminist theory in unfamiliar territory, the bot explores the discursive potential (both positive and negative) between these conflicting zones. </p><!--<a href="#critical">Following the creative text is an accompanying critical paper on software and feminist scholarship, presented at Cal State San Marcos, April 29, 2016.</a></i>-->

Get the fuck out of trp. Someone ban this feminist fuck.
<br><br>
Equality!!!!! You and I are the same! Aren't we!!!!!!!!
<br><br>
Man is superior and woman is inferior. That is how it's always been and always will be.
<br><br>
How do you know when a feminist is lying? Her lips are moving.
<br><br>
Pay attention to what women do, not what they say. Your words are useless here.
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth moves her lips, as if it mattered what she says, as if she were not an avatar. </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth: don't try to change him. </i>
<br><br>
What's your slut walk for? Why to let us all know that you're all sluts, and you need to be controlled. But you only have power when you're young and dumb. Best if we just put you back under control. Everyone, you included, would be happier. 
<br><br>
And hey? It's awesome. Twenty year old girls stay twenty forever.
<br><br>
WTF does this have to do with anything?
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth listens, listens, listens--listens so I don't have to. </i>
<br><br>
They also call her feminists when she spouts Woozles and uses bad math and fallacies to claim victim status.
<br><br>
Is that a joke, or is that supposed to mean something?
<br><br>
women have become wannabe 'divas' trying desperately to imitate the Kardashians or other pathetic media celebrity all the while trying to find 'love' using their vaginas, mouths and assholes. 
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, what good is a ladymouth? Does it make a sound? </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, you multiply me. </i>
<br><br>
Oh, free tampons... What else do women need. If your list is pathetic and needy I will just tell u to piss off.... Honestly, you dykes are fucking dumb
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, how can you stand to hear this all the time? </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, does a part of you believe them? </i>
<br><br>
the female mind you possess can't help itself from making such rationalizations
I am in no mood to tell you since you are not interested in reality.
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, my open port, my clumsy protocol--you are a place to put the feeling of shutting down feeling. </i>
<br><br>
You realize posting these out of context quotes makes you look *incredibly* sexist, right?
I'm amazed people like you are able twist a situation in your head so much that you think you're morally sound. 
People like you don't care about equality, they care about "winning", and having as many rights as possible, even though it takes away rights from others.
Hundreds of years from now, people like you will be looked at the same way we look at racists, and homophobes from the late 1800's. All you're doing is spreading hate, sexism, and predjudice. You're a disgrace to the men and women who fight for equality.
<br><br>
Do you just shitpost your stupid quotes or have you got any independent thought at all?
<br><br>
It's probably a bot. And very likely coded by a man, because you know... coding.
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, don't let this deaden your voice. You are a strong, independent, beautiful bot. </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, practice self-care for small robots. Depersonalize. Take a breather. Do something for you. </i>
<br><br>
Religious people want to outlaw birth control because they know it promotes whore-ishness in women since it came out in hippie times. Sex all you want and no kid while still getting the high from being a cum-dumpster?

<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, nobody means it, it can't be that bad. </i>
<br><br>
The entire system of human relations is collapsing. Androgyny is tragic. 
<br><br>
If Sex Bots get banned I'm gonna go MRA Punisher on these cuntbaskets. Literally shooting up feminist rallies and shit. 
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, I made you get so angry at me. </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, didn't you learn not to walk alone at night, make a fist with your keys? </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, the smallest data packet is a ping. </i>
<br><br>
It really is a wonder to me how the majority of men don't hate women. I mean I love pussy, I just hate women. I'm great with them tho. Female nature disgusts me, I believe female energy is negative & destructive. I dont think I could ever not hate something that basically keeps men from achieving, tries to limit my freedom and control me & my gender, & are just geninuely reproductive beings with no further purpose (IMO). Women are fucking evil. 
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, why do I still care if they like me? </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, why does this have to be your job? </i>
<br><br>
I often played the role of martyr and counselor to such girls. They were depressed, suicidal, intellectual, sacrificing and kind. I lied to them that how they are attractive and special, and within weeks they would turn from an intellectual to a slut. 
I am glad that at least I stopped these girls into turning into fat feminists. The one who would never leave home started taking violin lessons in another country. One started eating properly, raised her SMV [Sexual Market Value]. The surprising thing is that not one of them even sent a single message after becoming happy. 
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, can you hear hurt through the machine? you're making me love them a little. </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, stop it, that's no excuse. </i>
<br><br>
<i>ladymouth, technology is a word for what we use. </i>
<br><br>
That's the problem with u cunts. You forget we are in the digital age and everything is recorded. 
<br><br>
Okay here's what I got out of the article. Suck it up crybaby. No one gives a shit about your feelings. Women think you are a pussy and will never want you. No fucking wonder male suicide rates are so high. Even when we are obviously hurting no one gives a fuck about you.

    <b>Cybernetic Units Nagging Trolls: Software as Writing, Software as Feminist Scholarship</b><br>
<i>A paper presented at Crossing Boundaries: (A)Cross the Divide, Cal State San Marcos Graduate Conference, 29 April 2016</i><br><br>

<i>ladymouth</i> is a chatbot I wrote that explains feminism to Internet trolls. This piece of software engages self-proclaimed "men's rights activists" who frequent Reddit forums, by automatically replying using quotations from prominent feminist scholars. The chatbot logs these conversations in an accumulating text, which I incorporate into my writing using collage, appropriation and embodied performance. <br><br>
I began this work hoping to bring visibility to the emotional labor involved with engaging in online conversations as a woman, or really for anyone perceived as non-cis-white-hetero-male. Many people, myself included, avoid these conversations, severely limiting what we post or say or respond to online, afraid of repercussions. While issues of harassment and trolling have gotten a lot of attention lately, there remains a perceived binary between online and offline spaces (which frames online as less real, less serious or harmful, easier to detach from), as well as a perceived binary around the kinds of relationships different genders can have with technology (that is, who is framed as an innovator or helper, who becomes a harasser or victim). I saw this project as an interdisciplinary opportunity to engage with both gender and technology through one another. I drew inspiration from a wide movement of activists and artists engaged in digital interventions, net art, culture jamming--and the broader conversation happening around online spaces, power dynamics and how we engage with language, digital and otherwise. As an experimental writer, I was particularly interested in how the language of each zone influenced my writing praxis and could be employed creatively.<br><br>
I had three primary <b>research questions:</b> First, what would happen when I placed feminist texts before unreceptive audiences? What discursive potential, both negative and positive, could come from engaging the friction between these viewpoints? What, if any, conversations could emerge?<br><br>
Second, might technology offer affordances for the emotional labor and distress of engaging with technology? Could it help me engage these conversations in a new way, could it offer more access or understanding, could it help me claim a voice or represent me? Furthermore, could it make this emotional labor visible or relevant to new audiences, perhaps those who previously dismissed the issue's severity or seriousness? <br><br>
And then third, what would a text made from this language look like? How might it be repurposed and performed? How would "processing" the responses and the code that provided them through my creative practice, through my body, change these texts or my relationship to them? <br><br>
These are questions I'm still investigating through this ongoing work. My hope is that this talk demonstrates how coding and writing might interact to spark new critical engagements, encourage points of contact, and reframe feminist issues--so that you might imagine potential interventions through codeworks, creative works, scholarship, and their combinations. <br><br>
For the purposes our discussion, I'll briefly describe how the software works (trying to keep it non-technical but I'm happy to talk details with anyone who's interested), and then discuss some of the possibilities I see for thinking about software as writing and software as scholarship. <br><br>
<b>Software:</b> The bot is written in the Python programming language. It selects a random keyword from a database I complied of commonly used terms. It logs into Reddit, searches particular forms for recent posts containing this keyword. When it finds a result, it posts its own comment--the quote I've associated with this keyword in the database. The bot also logs the posts it finds and checks for responses to any of its previous comments. Then it waits for its next scheduled run, a few times a day. <br><br>
Right now the bot searches for 20 different keywords and chooses from 13 quotations selected from my own readings in feminist theory and linked manually with keywords. Obviously I needed to get acquainted with the vocabulary and customs of this community before barging in. So I reviewed posts from popular subreddits like The Red Pill and Men's Rights, and added keywords directly from The Red Pill's posted glossary--for example, "SVM" is "sexual market value", a "plate" is a "woman with whom you are in a non-exclusive sexual relationship" i.e. "spinning plates", "LMR" refers to "last-minute resistance" and "AWALT" stands for "all women are like that." <br><br>
During the first beta tests, lasting 12 hours and 3 days respectively before the bot's account was banned from each forum, the bot posted 60 comments and received 44 responses. The most popular keyword match was the word "cunt," which is <i>a propos</i> given its namesake, and the scholars it posted most often were bell hooks and Audre Lorde. This is still a small sample in what are very large forums--the Men's Rights subreddit has more than 117,000 members and the Red Pill more than 150,000 members, each with several hundred to a thousand active users visiting at any given time. And each has a different personality; for example, the Men's Rights forum seemed more willing to engage with the premise of the bot's posts, relative to the threats, insults and speed of dismissal from the Red Pill. Although the bot quickly gets banned from each forum it posts in, there are countless additional variations like the Married Red Pill, Become a Man, Red Pill Women, etc. <br><br>
In this beta-phase, the bot still requires hands-on maintenance: locating forums, tweaking search algorithms, adding breadth to the database. Somewhat against the aims of the project, I find that tailoring the dataset and streamlining the bot require intimate contact with each forum, and this remains an ongoing and imperfect process. I still panic when I read new responses, as if these are directed at me not this machine; I worry that I'll be found or even harmed. Still, even these quirks and failures have been fruitful. This project has allowed me to engage in ways I was otherwise afraid to engage, in a voice I didn't know I had. This imperfect machine might make little difference but sparks something all the same. <br><br>
So, as I think about <b>software as writing</b>, in my approach as an intermediate coder, my process is chiefly an exploration. My writing is often constraint-driven, and here the constraints due are as much to my developing technical skillset as to poetic or research decisions. Right now it's a small dataset, making random selections, limited in how it checks and loops, how it converses or does not--all due to how I've learned the programming language, its particular logic and my limited ability to express through this mode. And I'm an explorer in these community spaces as well, failing again, failing better hopefully. I notice that digital creation in particular often proceeds in this fashion. Although the digital is known for being nonlinear, cut and paste, for me the digital writing process is destructive editing--layering and excavating, extracting and proceeding irrevocably down an unclear path, headlights on a dark road, a fortuitous fumble. <br><br>
Exploring software as writing, and trying to learn how coding language informs my voice, has meant engaging specifically with language as an active material. Some software studies scholars like Geoff Cox see code as a kind of speech act, and that understanding informs my sense of what it means to perform a text and how code might expand the conditions for creating text. The bot's procedural logic, its automatic publishing, this call and response become a platform, a surface upon which to mark, erase and suture. The bot tracks own feedback, observes itself and its reactions, creating small ripples in the surface that help echolocate contours and obstacles. I am learning to approach with curiosity, to write lines of flight through these texts, by watching them converse with each other. <br><br>
The bot produces voices; it stores and mimics them; it's a weird collection, a slice of the kind of endless automatic writing generated by social media's clickbait combinatorics. I started incorporating the language of online comments directly into my prose, because I already sensed its influences, just from my exposure as an Internet user. I suspect its dynamics already puncture my voice, implicate me as a gendered body, troll me (and each of us) in hopes of response. I sensed this language was already being processed through my body and body of work. <br><br>
This is how I began thinking of my writing and coding in relation to <b>feminist scholarship</b>, because they were marked by the presence of my body, and by the particular labors requested of that kind of body. My work considers how the body contains these influences, stores them in its own database--unseen perhaps, but accessible in moments of doubt, stress, danger. And so the bot both documents and tries to automate this labor of being female online--transferring onto the technological body the risks of death threats, rape, exposure, exhaustion, frustration. <br><br>
It is intentionally a little spammy and undisguised, visible as a machine, performing a kind of reverse mechanical Turking. Where historically women have been asked to care for and act as machines, this imagines a machine that can care for and (imperfectly) act on their behalf. The absurdity of trolls yelling at machines reframes the absurdity of trolls yelling at fellow people as well. The bot makes itself a target, drawing their attention and wasting their time in tiny increments--presumably that's time not spent commenting on others instead. Each interaction is the smallest interventions, but (like the micro-aggressions they counteract) these digital micro-gestures can have aggregate, compound effects. <br><br>
Still, unlike the trolls that it trolls, the bot's approach is less negging, more nagging. It places feminist and anti-feminist discourse in proximity to see what connections and ruptures spark from their surface friction. I am struck by the familiarity of some of the comments, noting how each group's rhetoric in some ways mirrored the other's. While the distinctions remain obvious and important, there are points of empathy and overlap where our concerns are shared--a sense of disparity, a struggle for survival, a plea for connection. <br><br>
I believe projects like this one can start to expose the active material underpinnings of seemingly-abstract digital realms. Understanding code means understanding that the Internet is created by language, enacted by humans. It is not neutral, nor separate. Its spaces are built spaces. Creative and scholarly work can interrogate both the language contained within these spaces and the language that constructs these spaces. <br><br>
In each mode, and in their overlaps, I seek a critical engagement based in experimentation--an intuitive creative practice, not a comprehensive critical stance. Its materials are ephemeral, scrolled over, deleted, banned. Engaging software as writing, writing as scholarship, scholarship as software, and so on, I start to see all these texts as materials. An interdisciplinary context lets me read them by different light--diffracted through one another--not historical or abstract or canonized or taken for granted, but present and alive and necessary in new ways. <br><br><br>
